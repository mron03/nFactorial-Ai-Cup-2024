This project is an AI chatbot that uses gpt to answer customer queries. 
Further the dialog summary is sent to manager in a concise format.
This bot is very useful for business that have high load of people messages. Since employees do not have time to answer all of them, my solution helps to automatize this process, which leads to better customer satisfaction.

The bot is used using Twilio API to host whatsapp account, ngrok, and ec2 instance on amazon. Also Postgres server hosted on amazon is used to store user feedbacks, complaints and suggestions.
Main functionalities:
1. Booking of table
2. Ordering of food
3. Leaving feedback, complaint and suggestion
4. Report on the user requests in time period of day, week and month
5. Managers can get a short summaries of feedbacks, complaint and suggestions stores in database

For managers to be able to ask for report and summaries, they should send specific commands
"день" - report on last 24 hours
"неделя - report on last 7 days
"месяц" - report on last 30 days
"опиши отзывы" - summary of feedbacks
"опиши жалобы" - summary of complaints
"опиши предложения" - summary of suggestions
